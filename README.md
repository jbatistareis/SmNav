### SmNav, a lightweight Dropbox client for Android *~~that tries to not be as terrible as the official~~*
My main motivaion for this project is that i (*as you can see*) don't like the official Dropbox client, which was a hassle to use while i was in colege.
This is a revamped version, the first one was very basic, had its fair share of bugs, but did the job.
Built with Ionic, it has some personal QoL changes comparated to the official.
